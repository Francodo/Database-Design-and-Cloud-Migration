# Database-Design-and-AWS Cloud-Migration

Background

Typically, small business organizations start to gather and store information in a spreadsheet simply becasuse needs and requirements are limited. As business grows, there is the need for expansion in different areas of operation. The need and pain identified form the basis for this experiment of creating a Postgres database from the available Excel worksheet, applying ETL pipeline and finally migrating the data to Amazon Cloud environment.


Problem Description / Business Requirement

Gamepiont Corp is experiencing explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with its new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 10 person operation to 300 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR department at Gameponit is having trouble keeping up with the growth since they are still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has become increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands.

As such, the HR department has tasked you, as the new data architect, to design and build a database capable of managing their employee information.

Dataset
